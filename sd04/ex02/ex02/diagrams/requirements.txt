Core Requirements for the Contact Management System:

1. **Data Structure**:
   - Define a `Contact` structure with the following fields:
     - Integer ID
     - Name (string)
     - Phone (string)
     - Email (string)
     - City (string)
     - Address (string)

2. **File Handling**:
   - Load contacts from a specified CSV file.
   - Save contacts back to the same CSV file, using a temporary file for safety.

3. **Validation**:
   - Ensure ID is a positive integer and unique.
   - Name and city must be non-empty after trimming whitespace.
   - Phone must contain only digits and typical symbols, with at least one digit.
   - Email must contain one '@' with non-empty local and domain parts, and at least one dot in the domain.
   - Address may be empty.
   - Skip invalid lines with a warning without crashing the program.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Implement a menu loop with options:
     - List all contacts
     - Search contacts by name or city substring
     - Add a new contact
     - Update an existing contact
     - Delete a contact
     - Save and exit
   - Re-prompt for invalid input.

5. **Memory Management**:
   - Track the maximum ID of loaded contacts.
   - Free allocated memory for contacts when no longer needed.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle file opening errors gracefully.
   - Report any write errors during the save process.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear documentation in the README.md file, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.
